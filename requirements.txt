# Real-Time Temperature Logger Requirements
# This project uses only Python standard library modules

# No external dependencies required
# The following are standard library modules used:
# - collections (for deque)
# - time (for performance testing)
# - random (for test data generation)

# Optional development dependencies for enhanced testing:
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0
# black>=23.0.0
# flake8>=6.0.0

# For production monitoring (optional):
# psutil>=5.9.0  # For memory usage monitoring
# matplotlib>=3.6.0  # For visualization of temperature data
